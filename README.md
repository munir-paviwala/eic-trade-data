# East India Company Trade Data (1660-1834)

This repository stores the data used in Digital visualisation of the British East India Company's trading activities. 
The data is compiled from the historical sources which are available at [Citations Page](https://github.com/munir-paviwala/eic-trade-data/blob/main/CITATION.cff).

# For replication: Sources of the Data

I am compiling the data from two major works of historians.

For the period between 1660 to 1760: I am relying more on the data collected by _K. N. Chaudhari in his work The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company 1660-1760_ published in 1976.

For the period between 1760 to 1834: I am relying on the data collected by _H. V. Bowen in his book titled The Business of Empire: The East India Company and Imperial Britain, 1756â€“1833_ published in 2005.

In my knowledge, this is the first and only time someone has compiled the full dataset of the trading activities of the EIC.

## if you want to access these datasets:
Here is the link to the [Bowen's dataset](https://resources.amdigital.co.uk/eic/map/data/csv/data.csv)

I have cleaned the data for [K. N. Chaudhari](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTDQB8CjsGwJyRuEdWOesOBuucD2lBb- ).


# Note on Data Merging for replication  

As I was dealing with these two different datasets. There were a few categories that were missing in either side. Or had some overalaps with other categories from the other dataset. 

Hence, to merge both these datasets, I had to merge a few of the categories in the final [visualisation available at the front end](munirpaviwala.com).   

Here is the table pointing out the merging decisions.
